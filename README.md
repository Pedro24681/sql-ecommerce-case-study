> A comprehensive SQL case study demonstrating advanced query techniques, business analytics, and data-driven insights for e-commerce operations.



# Project Overview

This repository showcases advanced SQL analytics applied to a realistic e-commerce database. It demonstrates proficiency in complex queries, window functions, CTEs, business intelligence, and translating data into actionable insights.


# Quick Start

# Prerequisites
- MySQL 8.0+ or PostgreSQL 12+ installed
- Basic SQL knowledge
- Command-line or GUI database client (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)

# Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Pedro24681/sql-ecommerce-case-study.git
cd sql-ecommerce-case-study

# 2. Run the setup script in your SQL client
# This creates tables and loads sample data
source setup.sql
# OR for PostgreSQL: \i setup.sql

# 3. Explore the queries
# Open and run queries from:
# - 02_business_questions.sql
# - 03_advanced_analytics.sql
```



# Database Architecture

**4 Core Tables** | **Normalized Design** | **Referential Integrity**

```
┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│  Customers  │◄──────┤   Orders    │──────►│  Products   │
└─────────────┘       └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
                             │
                             ▼
                      ┌──────────────┐
                      │Order_Details │
                      └──────────────┘
```

- **Customers**: 50+ customer records with lifetime value metrics
- **Orders**: Transaction history with status tracking
- **Products**: Catalog with pricing, inventory, and categories
- **Order_Details**: Line-item details with calculated totals

 See [DATABASE_SCHEMA.md](DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) for complete schema documentation

# Featured Queries

# 1. Customer Lifetime Value Analysis
Calculates predicted customer value using purchase frequency, recency, and spending patterns.

```sql
-- Demonstrates: CTEs, Window Functions, CASE logic
-- Business Value: Identify high-value customers for retention programs
-- File: 02_business_questions.sql (Question 5)
```

# 2. RFM Segmentation for Churn Risk
Segments customers by Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value to predict churn.

```sql
-- Demonstrates: Multiple CTEs, PERCENT_RANK(), Complex scoring
-- Business Value: Proactive churn prevention campaigns
-- File: 02_business_questions.sql (Question 6)
```

# 3. Product Performance with Trend Analysis
Compares current vs. previous period performance with growth calculations.

```sql
-- Demonstrates: Multi-CTE design, COALESCE(), Period comparison
-- Business Value: Inventory planning and product optimization

# Technical Implementation

# SQL Dialects Supported

This project demonstrates SQL concepts using both MySQL and PostgreSQL syntax:

- **setup.sql & 01_schema_creation.sql**: MySQL 8.0+ syntax (AUTO_INCREMENT, MySQL functions)
- **02_business_questions.sql & 03_advanced_analytics.sql**: PostgreSQL 12+ syntax (::NUMERIC casting, INTERVAL)

> ** Learning Note:** The queries showcase advanced SQL patterns applicable to both databases. Converting between dialects typically requires minor adjustments:
> - PostgreSQL `::NUMERIC` → MySQL `CAST(... AS DECIMAL)`  
> - PostgreSQL `INTERVAL '12 months'` → MySQL `INTERVAL 12 MONTH`  
> - PostgreSQL-specific table references updated to match actual schema

**For Production Use:** Choose one database and apply consistent syntax throughout. The analytical patterns and business logic remain universal.

# Query Complexity Levels
- **Beginner**: Basic SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY
- **Intermediate**: JOINs, subqueries, aggregation
- **Advanced**: Window functions, CTEs, complex analytics
- **Expert**: Multi-level CTEs, recursive queries, optimization

# Performance Considerations
- Strategic indexing on foreign keys and date columns
- Efficient use of CTEs vs. subqueries
- Proper filtering before aggregation
- Optimized window function partitioning


# Learning Resources

# For Beginners
Start with `01_schema_creation.sql` to understand the data model, then explore simpler queries in `02_business_questions.sql`.

# For Intermediate Users
Focus on `02_business_questions.sql` to see practical applications of window functions and CTEs.

# For Advanced Users
Dive into `03_advanced_analytics.sql` for complex multi-CTE patterns and sophisticated business logic.
